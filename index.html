                                <h5 class="font-bold mb-2 text-gold-400">What is Graphene Coating?</h5>
                                <p class="mb-3">Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice - the strongest material known to science. When infused into ceramic coatings, it creates unprecedented protection that's 200x stronger than steel.</p>

                                <h5 class="font-bold mb-2 text-gold-400">Why Graphene is Superior:</h5>
                                <p>The honeycomb carbon structure creates an impenetrable barrier while remaining flexible. This prevents the micro-cracking common in traditional ceramics, while the thermal properties eliminate water spot etching - the #1 enemy of ceramic coatings.</p>
